    data = json.load(data_file)

total_commits = 0
added_lines = 0
removed_lines = 0

for day in data['days']:
    for commiter in day['commiters']:#itterating through commiters that made commits on that day
        total_commits =  total_commits + commiter['commits_num']
        added_lines = added_lines + commiter['added_lines']
        removed_lines = removed_lines + commiter['removed_lines']
```
