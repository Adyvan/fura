# Fura ðŸš›
Fura is CLI tool for analysing git repositories.

 - **Portable** ðŸ‘£: Fura is a perfect cross-platform tool. Single binary, no dependencies.  Just run and it works
 - **Perfect for experiments** ðŸ”¬: Perfect match with other languages. Integrate Fura to your script or notebook. Use it to create something great. 
 - **Rich data** ðŸ“š: Application scans all available branches and resulting data has information about all **renames**, **merges**, **binary files**. 

# Installation
Just download binary for your OS and put it in folder with repo or other place from which you will start it.
Binaries are available for [MacOC 64 bit](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/releases/download/v1.0/fura-darwin-amd64.zip) , [Windows 64bit](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/releases/download/v1.0/fura-windows-amd64.exe.zip) , [Linux 64bit](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/releases/download/v1.0/fura-linux-amd64.zip)


# Examples
To use the binary file you must launch terminal and launch it by writing `./fura` (for macos or linux) or `fura` (for Windows). In Windows it can be launched without entering the terminal. You can either put binary file to the folder with repository either pass the `-r` param with path of repo.

After finishing running data will be saved to json with the name of repository.

You can pass `-output` param to change the output file name. 
For more info about params look [wiki page](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/wiki/Params-list)

The resulting data is in json format. Check our [wiki](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/wiki/Data-format) for more info about the data format. After this you can use jupyter notebook and write your code for writing different statistics. 

For example you can use code from [examples directory](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/tree/master/examples) to calculate total number of commits,added and removed lines for repo. 
For example using this basic script on react repo you will get result ![alt text](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/blob/master/images/basic_example.png)

You can get this jupither notebook file [here](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/blob/master/examples/basic_example.ipynb)

You can build dayes disctibution charts ![alt text](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/blob/master/images/days_disctribution.png)

Example of this jupither notebook you can find [here](https://github.com/cali4888/fura/blob/master/examples/dead_code.ipynb)


# Known issues 
Progress window can lag if you change size of terminal after start of the scan. 
Do not hesitate to report any bugs that you could find.
